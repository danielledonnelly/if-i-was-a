        <h1>IF I WAS A...</h1>
        <p class="about">This project was inspired by my least favourite job interview question: if you were a cereal, what would you be? I was asked that many years ago and still think about it to this day.</p>
        <p> I don't anticipate I'll be having any job interviews in the near future, but still wanted to make a list of "If I Was A..." prompts, just for fun.</p>

        <div class="thing-tile">
            <h2>Cereal</h2>
            <p>I would be Surreal because I’m sweet, sarcastic, and eccentric, with a keen eye for out-of-the-box marketing ideas. <br> <br>If you have no idea what I’m talking about, look up “Surreal cereal advertisements” to familarize yourself with the best cereal brand of all time.

        <div class="thing-tile">
            <h2>Tool</h2>
            <p>I would be a Swiss Army knife because I can do a bit of everything. <br><br> I'm a stellar writer with a great eye for design. I have a lot of experience in data and development as well. Much like a Swiss Army Knife, I can be excel at a wide variety of tasks! </p>
            <div></div>
        </div>

        <div class="thing-tile">
            <h2>Flower</h2>
            <p>I would be a blue hydrangea, because blue hydrangeas symbolize apologies, gratitude, and understanding.
            <br><br> I think that sums me up pretty well! While I am pretty resilient, just as hydrangea flowers are, I do tend to apologize a bit too much. I'm also extremely appreciative and understanding with the people around me.
            </p>
            <div></div>
        </div>

        <div class="thing-tile">
            <h2>Fruit</h2>
            <p>I would be a starfruit (also known as carambola) because I’m efficient, loyal, and friendly! <br><br>
            That might not make much sense without some additional context... In Stardew Valley, star fruits are the most efficient fruit to farm. In Kingdom Hearts, start-shaped fruit represent loyalty and lifelong friendship.
            </p>
            <div></div>
        </div>

        <div class="thing-tile">
            <h2>Animal</h2>
            <p>I would be be a cat because I'm inquisitive, introverted, and I love napping. <br><br> 
              If I were smaller, I imagine I’d also love sleeping in boxes, lying down on keyboards, and knocking things off of countertops.</p>
            <div></div>
        </div>

        <div class="thing-tile">
            <h2>Color</h2>
            <p>I would be <span class="beef-blue">this specific shade of blue</span> because I’m bright and fun, but there’s more to me than meets the eye. <br><br>
            Bright blue is often associated with creativity, concentration, and clarity, which matches me well!
            </p>
            <div></div>
        </div>

        <div class="thing-tile">
          <h2>Song</h2>
          <p>I would be Danny Don’t You Know by NSP because I'm a bit of a nerd. 
            <br><br>I’m not going to elaborate much further, but if you look up the lyrics, I think you’ll get the picture!</p>
          <div></div>
        </div>

        <div class="thing-tile">
          <h2>Superhero</h2>
          <p>I would be the Flash because I like to work in fast-paced environments. <br><br> I’m quick, effective, and innovative. I value my time, and love finding new efficient ways to do everyday tasks.</p>
          <div></div>
        </div>

        <div class="thing-tile">
          <h2>Drink</h2>
          <p>I would be a soda because sometimes I’m bubbly and energized, while other times I’m chill and a bit more flat. <br><br>
            If I had to pick a specific brand or flavour, it would probably be Mountain Dew.
            </p>

        </div>

        <div class="thing-tile">
          <h2>Creature</h2>
          <p>I would be an alien because I'm intelligent and highly curious. <br><br>
          I'm pretty interested in science, data, and technology. I haven't been on earth for all that long yet and I'm always eager to learn as much as I possibly can.</p>
